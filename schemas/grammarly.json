However, unlike the Academic domain, it allows the use of some informal expressions, informal pronouns, and unclear antecedents.","This is the default style and uses a medium level of strictness.","The email genre is similar to the General domain and helps ensure that your email communication is engaging. In addition to catching grammar, spelling, and punctuation mistakes, Grammarly also points out the use of overly direct language that may sound harsh to a reader.","Casual is designed for informal types of writing and ignores most style issues. It does not flag contractions, passive voice, informal pronouns, who-versus-whom usage, split infinitives, or run-on sentences. This style is suitable for personal communication.","This is the most permissive style. It catches grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes but allows some leeway for those who want to intentionally bend grammar rules to achieve certain effects.
